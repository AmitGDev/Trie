**Overview**

This repository contains an implementation of a dynamic prefix trie in C++. A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings where each node represents a single character. This implementation provides functionality to insert strings into the trie and find the common prefix among inserted strings.

**Note:** This implementation is for demonstration purposes and may not be optimized for all use cases.

**Features**

- Trie Implementation:
  - Implements a dynamic prefix trie for efficient storage and retrieval of strings.
  - Supports insertion of strings and finding common prefixes among inserted strings.
- Simple Usage:
  - Provides straightforward functions for inserting strings and finding common prefixes.
- Versatility:
  - Suitable for various applications requiring prefix-based searching or string storage.

**Example Usage**

See the **Trie.cpp** file for examples demonstrating how to use the Trie implementation.

**Further Exploration**

This demonstration serves as a starting point for exploring trie data structures and their applications. You can further explore by:

- Adding additional functionality such as deletion of strings or searching for specific strings.
- Optimizing the implementation for specific memory or performance requirements.
- Testing the performance with various input sizes and string distributions.
